	Most of my work reflects a part of me that always feels a nostalgia of an unknown source, heroic feelings, love - its evils and virtues - , and the sadness of finding exactly what you were looking for after a long journey to get it.

	Creating right from my soul, shouting my thoughts without filters. I&#39;ve found this to be not just the most effective way for me to bring something to life, but also a way to feel what&#39;s around me, things that I would normally disregard or ignore. As a result, also a way of healing and learning how to live. Additionally I believe that creation should be fun and cool, and not just an academic performance or a technical practice.
